# CryptoClustering

### This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

### This repository contains an .ipynb file which segments cryptocurrencies by their price changes. The raw data is found in the Resources folder. In the analysis file, the original scaled data is first segmented by k-means clustering. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce features and subsequently allow for a reduction in the number of clusters. Elbow plots and scatter plots between the original scaled data and the PCA data are provided to compare the cluster analyses.

### This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
